-- Fix for 20260920090000: the ranking excluded `called` tickets while the derivation loop
-- included them, so a ticket already `called` kept a stale position 1 while the next ticket was
-- re-ranked to 1 and promoted to a second `called` (with a second your_turn notification).
-- Ranking now includes this barber's own `called` tickets so the head of the queue keeps
-- position 1. The pooled-ticket predicate (assigned_barber_id is null and is_pooled) is unchanged.
